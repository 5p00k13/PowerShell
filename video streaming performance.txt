1. Check Network Bandwidth and Speed
Test Internet Speed: While PowerShell doesn't have a built-in command for speed tests, you can use a third-party module like Speedtest.net to check your internet speed.

** Install-Module -Name Speedtest.Net -Force; Import-Module Speedtest.Net; Start-Speedtest

This will give you the download and upload speeds, which are crucial for streaming performance.

2. Check for Packet Loss
Ping Test: You can use the Test-Connection cmdlet to check for packet loss to a specific server or website.

** Test-Connection -ComputerName google.com -Count 100 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object Address, ResponseTime, StatusCode

If you notice high packet loss or latency, it may indicate a network issue.

3. Check Wi-Fi Signal Strength
Wi-Fi Signal Quality: If you're using a Wi-Fi connection, you can check the signal quality with the following command:

** netsh wlan show interfaces

Look for the Signal value, which indicates the Wi-Fi signal strength. A low percentage may suggest weak signal strength, which can affect streaming.

4. Check Network Adapter Performance
Network Adapter Status: You can view detailed information about your network adapter to check for errors or issues.

** Get-NetAdapter | Get-NetAdapterStatistics

This will show you packet statistics, which can help identify if your adapter is dropping packets or experiencing other issues.

5. Check System Resource Usage
CPU and Memory Usage: High CPU or memory usage can affect streaming performance. You can monitor these resources with:

** Get-Process | Sort-Object -Descending CPU | Select-Object -First 10 Name, CPU; Get-Process | Sort-Object -Descending WorkingSet | Select-Object -First 10 Name, WorkingSet

This will display the top processes consuming CPU and memory.

6. Check for Background Processes
List Running Processes: To see what processes are running that could be affecting performance:

** Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 10

Terminating unnecessary processes might improve streaming performance.

7. Check DNS Configuration
View DNS Settings: Incorrect DNS settings can slow down streaming. You can view your current DNS settings with:

** Get-DnsClientServerAddress

If you need to change your DNS servers, you can do so using the Set-DnsClientServerAddress cmdlet.

8. Check for Network Congestion
Monitor Network Traffic: Use PowerShell to monitor network traffic and identify if other devices or processes are using significant bandwidth:

** Get-NetAdapterStatistics

This will give you an overview of the bytes sent and received by your network adapters.

9. Check Browser Cache and Cookies
Clear Browser Cache and Cookies: While PowerShell doesn't directly manage browser caches, you can create scripts that clear temporary files or use a tool like Clear-DnsClientCache to flush DNS:

** Clear-DnsClientCache

View DNS Cache Entries:

Run the following command to see all the current DNS cache entries:

** ipconfig /displaydns

Count DNS Cache Entries:

To count the number of DNS cache entries, you can use PowerShell to process the output of ipconfig /displaydns:


** (ipconfig /displaydns | Select-String -Pattern "Record Name").Count
